This is a finished memoir template to start your thesis from.

Tips
----

* remove the ```.git/``` folder after cloning this repository and start a new one with ```git init```.
* Start a new line with each sentence. This will make it easier for git to track the changes later on.
* When you submit your thesis for correction, make a new annotated tag ```git tag -s v1 -m 'submitted for correction to .. on DATE'``` to create a snapshot of the current status.
* Make a new branch for each submission and include the received corrections in that branch. Meanwhile, keep working on your ```master``` branch. This will make it easier for you to merge the corrections later.
